This project aims to procedurally generate curves such that they resemble handwriting.

Here is an example:

.. image:: ../sample.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: A sample of procedurally generated text
   :align: center

This project was originally a computer graphics (CSCI 580) project at Western Washington University under the instruction of `Geof Matthews <http://github.com/geofmatthews/>`_

This has been inactive since I have been working on other things but please contact me if you would like to contribute. I can be reached at spollard at cs dot uoregon dot edu.
